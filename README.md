# Segment-Intersection 

## Description 
- This project is an exploratory endeavor into the concept of linear interpolation (lerp) with the ultimate goal of applying this mathematical principle to a self-driving world simulation. Linear interpolation is a fundamental concept in mathematics and computer science that is used to find a point or value that exists between two known points or values. This technique is pivotal in various applications, including animations, simulations, and, as explored in this project, the development of autonomous vehicle algorithms.

- The inspiration and foundational knowledge for this project have been derived from an educational [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHOLQJo0FjQ), which serves as a stepping stone into the complex and fascinating world of self-driving technologies.
